## Deleting Tables In phpMyAdmin

In working with a database, situations may arise where an action on a table renders its further use in the database incorrect.
For the phpMyAdmin service, the solution to this problem is to delete all tables and re-import the database dump.

- Select your database.
- Go to the "Structure" tab.
- Choose "Check All" for the tables.
- In the context menu for the selected tables, choose "Drop" and confirm the deletion.
- Re-import the database.

This method allows you to experiment with the database by deleting and modifying its elements, as you can always restore the tables to their original state.
