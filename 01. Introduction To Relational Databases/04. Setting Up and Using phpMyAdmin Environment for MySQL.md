## eleting Tables in phpMyAdmin

In working with a database, situations may arise where an action on a table renders its further use in the database incorrect.
For the phpMyAdmin service, the solution to this problem is to delete all tables and re-import the database dump.

1. Select your database.
2. Go to the "Structure" tab.
3. Choose "Check All" for the tables.
4. In the context menu for the selected tables, choose "Drop" and confirm the deletion.
5. Re-import the database.

This method allows you to experiment with the database by deleting and modifying its elements, as you can always restore the tables to their original state.
